#!/usr/bin/env bash

# The intent of this script is to use Bash as a template engine. It echoes the
# contents of each file argumennt with shell parameter expansion. This allows
# environment variables to be embedded or advanced expansion syntax can be used
# for greater versatility. This command will also process text piped via stdin.
