Use bash as a template engine. [Parameter expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html)
is a powerful feature supporting interpolation of variables into text, injecting
the output of arbitrary shell commands (careful!), with many other conveniences
such as default values, case-conversion, search and replace, etc.
